### Introduction

This is a repository of general concepts for learning Modern C++.
All concepts are developed into some sort of application.
This repository can be seen as a type of tutorial for begginers of C++.
Its also used by myself for figuring concepts out and applying them.
In this manner, this repository is also a brain dump of sorts.
